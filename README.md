## Rules

Igrosk is a two-player game played on a 6x6x4 3D board. Each player controls either white ⚪ or black ⚫ pieces. The players take turns to play the game, with the white ⚪ player going first. Each turn consists of one or more moves. The first move on every turn, a drop, is to place a piece on the board, followed by moving one or more free pieces from the same active square 🟨 one square forward, backwards, right or left, only to adjacent squares that have less pieces. A piece or a set of pieces are considered free if no opponent’s pieces are above them. A player can perform any amount of legal moves on the same turn, after the initial drop. A piece can not end up in the same position as it started on the same turn. There can only be a maximum of four pieces on one square. At the end of the turn all towers 🗼, stacked sets of pieces, with height of 4 become deactivated ❌, meaning the pieces within them cannot be moved at all. The square 🟨 is considered controlled by a player if the square is active and their piece is at the top. The winner of the game is the player that controls half or more active corners on the board.
